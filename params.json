  "body": "## Welcome to the Detroit Neighborhood Map.\r\nThis site is to showcase the interactive potential of a google map connected to 3rd party APIs. I only hardcoded 5 locations into the application for now, but more locations could easily be added to make the map more useful.\r\n\r\n###Using the Application\r\nTo use this application, download the github repo. Open the index.html file using an internet browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The application will display a map with a list of locations on the left side of the window. The locations are displayed on the map with markers. Clicking on the location name in the list will open an infowindow on the map, displaying information about the location. The information can also be accessed by directly clicking on the marker on the map. The locations in the list can be filtered using the text input box at the top of the list and the markers will be filtered accordingly.\r\n\r\n### 3rd Party APIs\r\nI chose to use several 3rd party APIs in my application. I integrate venue reviews from [Foursquare.com](https://foursquare.com), links to relevant [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) pages as well as a photo from [Flickr](https://flickr.com)\r\n",
