#Neighborhood Map of Detroit MI

This site is to showcase the interactive potential of a google map connected to
3rd party APIs. I only hardcoded 5 locations into the application for now, but
more locations could easily be added to make the map more useful.

###3rd Party APIs

I chose to use several 3rd party APIs in my application. I integrate venue
reviews from foursquare.com, links to relevant
wikipedia pages as well as a photo from Flickr.
