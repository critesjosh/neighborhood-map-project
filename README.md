#Neighborhood Map of Detroit MI

This site is to showcase the interactive potential of a google map connected to
3rd party APIs. I only hardcoded 5 locations into the application for now, but
more locations could easily be added to make the map more useful.

##Using the application
To use this application, download the github repo. Open the index.html file
using an internet browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The application
will display a map with a list of locations on the left side of the window. The
locations are displayed on the map with markers. Clicking on the location name
in the list will open an infowindow on the map, displaying information about the
location. The information can also be accessed by directly clicking on the marker
on the map. The locations in the list can be filtered using the text input box
at the top of the list and the markers will be filtered accordingly.

###3rd Party APIs

I chose to use several 3rd party APIs in my application. I integrate venue
reviews from foursquare.com, links to relevant
wikipedia pages as well as a photo from Flickr.
